# Docs

This directory is a collection of documentation about the SDK library, CLI, and concepts.

If you are looking for documentation for migrating your code when you upgrade SDK versions, see [migrations](./migrations/README.md).

The easiest way to get a handle on the SDK is to run through the [sample project: issue tracker tutorial](./tutorials/issue-tracker/README.md). 
Docs in this directory will help further your understanding of the concepts touched on in the tutorial.

Godocs on exported library package code (such as `resource`, `operator`, `plugin`, and `k8s`) are also considered documentation.

## Base Concepts of the SDK

The kernel at the center of most of what the SDK can be used for is a [Kind](custom-kinds/README.md), expressed in-code using the `resource.Object` interface and `resource.Kind` type, and typically written in CUE as a source-of-truth. 

Instances of a kind, referred to as "resources" or "objects," are then stored in an API server. The pre-built solution the SDK gives you currently is a kubernetes API server, 
but importantly, all of the tooling outside of the `k8s` package is actually implementation-agnostic.

To work directly with resources, you can use an instance of a `resource.Client`, or one of the [Store](./resource-stores.md)-type objects which simplifies interactions by allowing you to treat the system as a key-value store.

An important component of the SDK is the use of the operator pattern. Using the `operator` package, you can set up an operator to watch for changes to one or more kinds, and take actions based on the nature of those changes. This allows behavior to be decoupled from the actual input API, which is especially useful in the context of an API server which has multiple paths for a user to enter, modify, or delete resources. For more details on this, see [Design Patterns](./design-patterns.md).

Finally, there is also layering on top of the grafana backend plugin SDK, allowing you to create a REST API backend which can tie into your kinds, 
to create a proxy to the back-end API server. This package will eventually become deprecated in favor of direct API server access from the front-end, 
and the use of a custom API server if additional non-standard routes are needed (see [Applications with Custom APIs](./application-design/README.md#applications-with-custom-apis)).

## Documentation Improvements

If you notice places where documentation is lacking, confusing, or is out of date, please do not hesitate to create an [issue](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-app-sdk/issues) in this repository noting the specifics of what you found, and we will work to improve it. We also welcome documentation contributions as [Pull Requests](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-app-sdk/pulls).
