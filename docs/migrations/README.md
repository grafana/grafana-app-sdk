# Migrations

As the grafana-app-sdk is still both pre-1.0 and _experimental_, breaking changes may be introduced on minor version upgrades. 
This directory contains notes on the breaking changes (which are also typically in release notes on the first patch version 
of the minor version bump, for example, see [the v0.15.0 release notes](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-app-sdk/releases/tag/v0.15.0)), 
and instructions on what to do to migrate your project to the new version. Scripts may be included for more complex upgrades, if and when they occur. 

Minor version upgrades without a migration doc have no breaking changes or changes which are wholly handled by the `grafana-app-sdk generate` command.
